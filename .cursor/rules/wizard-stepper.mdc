### Wizard Structure Requirements
Every multi-step process must implement a standardized wizard component with:

#### 1. Visual Progress Indicator
- Progress bar with connecting line
- Step dots with numbers and labels
- Active step highlighting
- Completed steps indication

#### 2. Navigation Controls
- Previous/Next buttons
- Disable back button on first step
- Different text for last step (Finish vs Next)
- Step validation before allowing next

#### 3. Step Content Container
- Content wrapper for each step
- Form validation per step
- Data persistence between steps

### Wizard Styling Guidelines

#### Progress Bar Design
- Use flexbox for step alignment
- Implement connecting line between steps
- Style step dots with active/completed states
- Use consistent colors and transitions

#### Navigation Buttons
- Position buttons on opposite sides
- Style back button with secondary appearance
- Style next button with primary appearance
- Implement proper hover states and transitions

### Wizard Implementation Rules
- **Always show progress indicator** at the top
- **Disable back button** on first step
- **Show different text** for last step (Finish vs Next)
- **Validate current step** before allowing next
- **Save progress** automatically between steps
- **Allow step navigation** via progress dots (optional)
- **Show step titles** in current language
- **Handle form validation** per step
